The “sugar code” concept assumes the interaction of carbohydrates with inter and intra cellular components. This concept is the basis of therapy employing carbohydrate-derived chemicals as drugs. The “CARB” pharmacological potential is enhanced by the addition of pharmacophores and functional groups. We proposed an idea of “functional carb-pharmacophores” (FCP) as a new approach to compose functionalized sugar derivatives that have therapeutic potential and designed the collection of FCP. The collection consist of several functionalized sugar derivatives including thiosugar, anhydrosugar, sulfamidosugar and 1-4-Sthidisacharide motifs. They possessed anticancer properties. 
The aim of this project was: 
• to determine the mechanisms of anticancer actions of functional carbpharmacophores. 
These objective was realized through: 
• the analysis of cytotoxic and antiproliferative properties of FCPs in cancer and normal cells, 
• the analysis of cancer cells death pathways activated by FCPs (necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy) 
• the analysis of the expression of key genes in biological pathways activated in response to toxic drugs in cancer and normal cells incubated with selected FCPs. 
• the oxidative stress analysis induced by selected FCPs in astrocytoma cancer and normal cells. 
• FCPs uptake analysis by astrocytoma cancer cells 
• the analysis of genotoxicity of selected FCPs 
Obtained in this project result allowed to: 
• propose new research direction for developing CARB derivatives that have anticancer properties, 
• establish new therapeutic strategies against cancer using thiosugars
Moreover obtained data contributed to better understanding of basic cell biology of CARB functionalized derivatives. 
The international cooperation between the Wilkes University and the University of Lodz was a results of this research project.
