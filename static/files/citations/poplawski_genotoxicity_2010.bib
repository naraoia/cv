 abstract = {Urethane dimethacrylate ({UDMA}) is used in dental restorative materials in its polymeric form. However, the process of polymerization is usually incomplete and the monomers of {UDMA} can diffuse into the oral cavity and the pulp, reaching millimolar concentrations. In the present work we showed that {UDMA} at 0.1 and 1.0 {mM} decreased the viability of and induced {DNA} damage in lymphocytes in a concentration dependent manner, but it did not affect a plasmid {DNA} in vitro. {UDMA} at 1mM induced apoptosis in lymphocytes. The lymphocytes exposed to {UDMA} were able to repair their {DNA} within 60 min. Analysis with {DNA} repair enzymes Endo {III} and Fpg showed that {UDMA} induced mainly oxidative {DNA} lesions. Vitamin C and chitosan decreased genotoxic effect of {UDMA}. Our results show that monomers of {UDMA} may exert pronounced cyto- and genotoxic effects in human lymphocytes and chitosan can be considered as a protection against such effects.},
