 abstract = {{DNA} double-strand breaks ({DSBs}) are a serious threat to the cell, for if not or miss-repaired, they can lead to chromosomal aberration, mutation and cancer. {DSBs} in human cells are repaired via non-homologous {DNA} end joining ({NHEJ}) and homologous recombination repair pathways. In the former process, the structure of {DNA} termini plays an important role, as does the genetic constitution of the cells, through being different in normal and pathological cells. In order to investigate the dependence of {NHEJ} on {DSB} structure in normal and cancer cells, we used linearized plasmids with various, complementary or non-complementary, single-stranded or blunt {DNA} termini, as well as whole-cell extract isolated from normal human lymphocytes, chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells and lung cancer A549 cells. We observed a pronounced variability in the efficacy of {NHEJ} reaction depending on the type of ends. Plasmids with complementary and blunt termini were more efficiently repaired than the substrate with 3' protruding single-strand ends. The hierarchy of the effectiveness of {NHEJ} was on average, from the most effective to the least, A549/ normal lymphocytes/ K562. Our results suggest that the genetic constitution of the cells together with the substrate terminal structure may contribute to the efficacy of the {NHEJ} reaction. This should be taken into account on considering its applicability in cancer chemo- or radiotherapy by pharmacologically modulating {NHEJ} cellular responses.},
