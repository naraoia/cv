 abstract = {Oxidative stress is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration ({AMD}). We determined the extent of oxidative {DNA} damage and the kinetics of its removal as well as the genotypes of the Ser326Cys polymorphism of the {hOGG}1 gene in lymphocytes of 30 wet {AMD} patients and 30 controls. Oxidative {DNA} damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and its repair were evaluated by the comet assay and {DNA} repair enzymes. We observed a higher extent of endogenous oxidative {DNA} damage and a lower efficacy of its repair in {AMD} patients as compared with the controls. We did not find any correlation between the extent of {DNA} damage and efficacy of {DNA} repair with genotypes of the Ser326Cys polymorphism. The results obtained suggest that oxidative {DNA} damage and inefficient {DNA} repair can be associated with {AMD} and the variability of the {hOOG}1 gene may not contribute to this association.},
