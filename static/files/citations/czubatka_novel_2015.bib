 abstract = {1,5-Anhydro-6-deoxy-methane-sulfamido-d-glucitol ({FCP}5) is a functionalized carbohydrate containing functional groups that render it potentially therapeutically useful. According to our concept of ‘functional carb-pharmacophores’ ({FCPs}) incorporation of the methanesulfonamido pharmacophore to 1,5 glucitol could create a therapeutically useful compound. Our previous studies revealed that {FCP}5 was cytotoxic to cancer cells. Therefore, in this work we assessed the cytotoxic mechanisms of {FCP}5 in four cancer cell lines – {HeLa}, {LoVo}, A549 and {MCF}-7, with particular focus on {DNA} damage and repair. A broad spectrum of methods, including comet assay with modifications, {DNA} repair enzyme assay, plasmid relaxation assay, and {DNA} fragmentation assay, were used. We also checked the potential for {FCP}5 to induce apoptosis. The results show that {FCP}5 can induce {DNA} strand breaks as well as oxidative modifications of {DNA} bases. {DNA} lesions induced by {FCP}5 were not entirely repaired in {HeLa} cells and {DNA} repair kinetics differs from other cell lines. Results from molecular docking and plasmid relaxation assay suggest that {FCP}5 binds to the major groove of {DNA} with a preference for adenosine–thymine base pair sequences and directly induces {DNA} strand breaks. Thus, {FCP}5 may represent a novel lead for the design of new major groove-binding compounds. The results also confirmed the validity of functional carb-pharmacophores as a new source of innovative drugs.},
