 abstract = {In the paper we present a theoretical analysis of extension of the finite automaton built on DNA (introduced by the Shapiro team) to an arbitrary number of states and symbols. In the implementation we use a new idea of several restriction enzymes instead of one. We give arithmetical conditions for the existence of such extensions in terms of ingredients used in the implementation.},
