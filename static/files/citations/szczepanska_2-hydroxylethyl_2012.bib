 abstract = {{HEMA} (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), a methacrylate commonly used in dentistry, was reported to induce genotoxic effects, but their mechanism is not fully understood. {HEMA} may be degraded by the oral cavity esterases or through mechanical stress following the chewing process. Methacrylic acid ({MAA}) is the primary product of {HEMA} degradation. In the present work we compared cytotoxic and genotoxic effects induced by {HEMA} and {MAA} in human gingival fibroblasts ({HGFs}). A 6-h exposure to {HEMA} or {MAA} induced a weak decrease in the viability of {HGFs}. Neither {HEMA} nor {MAA} induced strand breaks in the isolated plasmid {DNA}, but both compounds evoked {DNA} damage in {HGFs}, as evaluated by the alkaline comet assay. Oxidative modifications to the {DNA} bases were monitored by the {DNA} repair enzymes Endo {III} and Fpg. {DNA} damage induced by {HEMA} and {MAA} was not persistent and was removed during a 120 min repair incubation. Results from the neutral comet assay indicated that both compounds induced {DNA} double strand breaks ({DSBs}) and they were confirmed by the γ-H2AX assay. Both compounds induced apoptosis and perturbed the cell cycle. Therefore, methacrylic acid, a product of {HEMA} degradation, may be involved in its cytotoxic and genotoxic action.},
