 abstract = {{BCR}/{ABL}-transformed chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}) cells accumulate numerous {DNA} double-strand breaks ({DSB}) induced by reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and genotoxic agents. To repair these lesions {BCR}/{ABL} stimulate unfaithful {DSB} repair pathways, homologous recombination repair ({HRR}), nonhomologous end-joining ({NHEJ}), and single-strand annealing ({SSA}). Here, we show that {BCR}/{ABL} enhances the expression and increase nuclear localization of {WRN} (mutated in Werner syndrome), which is required for processing {DSB} ends during the repair. Other fusion tyrosine kinases ({FTK}), such as {TEL}/{ABL}, {TEL}/{JAK}2, {TEL}/{PDGFÎ²R}, and {NPM}/{ALK} also elevate {WRN}. {BCR}/{ABL} induces {WRN} {mRNA} and protein expression in part by c-{MYC}-mediated activation of transcription and Bcl-{xL}-dependent inhibition of caspase-dependent cleavage, respectively. {WRN} is in complex with {BCR}/{ABL} resulting in {WRN} tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of its helicase and exonuclease activities. Activated {WRN} protects {BCR}/{ABL}-positive cells from the lethal effect of oxidative and genotoxic stresses, which causes {DSBs}. In addition, {WRN} promotes unfaithful recombination-dependent repair mechanisms {HRR} and {SSA}, and enhances the loss of {DNA} bases during {NHEJ} in leukemia cells. In summary, we postulate that {BCR}/{ABL}-mediated stimulation of {WRN} modulates the efficiency and fidelity of major {DSB} repair mechanisms to protect leukemia cells from apoptosis and to facilitate genomic instability.},
