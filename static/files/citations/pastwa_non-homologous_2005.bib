 abstract = {Double-strand breaks ({DSBs}) are the most serious {DNA} damage which, if unrepaired or misrepaired, may lead to cell death, genomic instability or cancer transformation. In human cells they can be repaired mainly by non-homologous {DNA} end joining ({NHEJ}). The efficacy of {NHEJ} pathway was examined in normal human lymphocytes and K562 myeloid leukemic cells expressing the {BCR}/{ABL} oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity and lacking p53 tumor suppressor protein. In our studies we employed a simple and rapid in vitro {DSB} end joining assay based on fluorescent detection of repair products. Normal and cancer cells were able to repair {DNA} damage caused by restriction endonucleases, but the efficiency of the end joining was dependent on the type of cells and the structure of {DNA} ends. K562 cells displayed decreased {NHEJ} activity in comparison to normal cells for 5' complementary {DNA} overhang. For blunt-ended {DNA} there was no significant difference in end joining activity. Both kinds of cells were found about 10-fold more efficient for joining {DNA} substrates with compatible 5' overhangs than those with blunt ends. Our recent findings have shown that stimulation of {DNA} repair could be involved in the drug resistance of {BCR}/{ABL}-positive cells in anticancer therapy. For the first time the role of {STI}571 was investigated, a specific inhibitor of {BCR}/{ABL} oncogenic protein approved for leukemia treatment in the {NHEJ} pathway. Surprisingly, {STI}571 did not change the response of {BCR}/{ABL}-positive K562 cells in terms of {NHEJ} for both complementary and blunt ends. Our results suggest that the various responses of the cells to {DNA} damage via {NHEJ} can be correlated with the differences in the genetic constitution of human normal and cancer cells. However, the role of {NHEJ} in anticancer drug resistance in {BCR}/{ABL}-positive cells is questionable.},
