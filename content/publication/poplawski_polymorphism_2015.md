abstract = "Endometrial cancer (EC) is the second most common malignancy associated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) family. The development of HNPCC is associated with defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway resulting in microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI is present in a greater number of EC than can be accounted for by inherited MMR mutations, therefore alternative mechanisms may underline defective MMR in EC, including polymorphic variation. AIM: We checked the association between EC occurrence and two polymorphisms of MMR genes: a 1032GtextgreaterA (rs4987188) transition in the hMSH2 gene resulting in a Gly22Asp substitution and a -93GtextgreaterA (rs1800734) transition in the promoter of the hMLH1 gene. MATERIAL AND METHODS: These polymorphisms were genotyped in DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 100 EC patients and 100 age-matched women by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. RESULTS: A positive association (OR 4.18; 95% CI 2.23-7.84) was found for the G/A genotype of the -93GtextgreaterA polymorphism of the hMLH1 gene and EC occurrence. On the ot-her hand, the A allele of this polymorphism was associated with decreased EC occurrence. The Gly/Gly genotype slightly increased the effect of the -93GtextgreaterA-G/A genotype (OR 4.52; CI 2.41-8.49). Our results suggest that the -93GtextgreaterA polymorphism of the hMLH1 gene singly and in combination with the Gly322Asp polymorphism of the hMSH2 gene may increase the risk of EC."
