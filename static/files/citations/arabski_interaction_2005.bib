 abstract = {Amoxicillin is a penicillin derivative belonging to a group of beta-lactam antibiotics used in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Clinical application of amoxicillin is underlined by its antibacterial activity, but little is known about its interaction with {DNA} of human cells. Using the alkaline comet assay we investigated the genotoxicity of amoxicillin in human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in H. pylori-infected and non-infected human gastric mucosa cells. To assess the role of reactive oxygen species in the genotoxicity of amoxicillin we employed a set of antioxidant and free radical scavengers, including Vitamins C and E, melatonin and the nitrone spin trap N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenyl-nitrone ({PBN}). Amoxicillin-induced {DNA} damage was completely repaired after 60 min. The vitamins, melatonin and the spin trap decreased the extent of the damage. The cells exposed to amoxicillin and treated with endonuclease {III} and 3-methyladenine-{DNA} glycosylase {II}, the enzymes recognizing oxidized bases displayed greater extent of {DNA} damage than those not treated with these enzymes. H. pylori non-infected gastric mucosa cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide repaired their {DNA} in a 60 min incubation, but the infected cells were not able to do so. The action of {DNA} repair enzymes, the vitamins, melatonin and {PBN} indicated that amoxicillin-induced oxidative {DNA} damage. The drug did not induce {DNA} strand breaks in isolated {pUC}19 plasmid {DNA}. Our results suggest that amoxicillin can induce {DNA} damage in human lymphocytes and gastric mucosa cells and this effect may follow from the production of reactive oxygen species. Cellular activation of the drug is needed to induce {DNA} damage. Free radical scavengers and antioxidants may be used to assist H. pylori eradication with amoxicillin to protect {DNA} of the host cells. Our results suggest also that H. pylori infection may alter gastric mucosa cells response to {DNA}-damaging agents and in this way contribute to initiation/promotion of cancer transformation of these cells induced by external or internal carcinogens.},
