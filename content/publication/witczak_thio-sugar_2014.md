abstract = "Diverse functionalized representatives of (1-4)-S-thiodisaccharides, 6–9 were synthesized and assessed for cytotoxicity and apoptosis against human cancer cell lines (A549, LoVo, MCF-7 and HeLa). The FCP 6 was more active against MCF-7 cells (i.e., an estrogen-dependent breast cancer line), whereas other (1-4)-S-thiodisaccharides showed strongest activity against A549 cells (i.e., a lung adenocarcinoma line). We propose to use a concept of functional ‘CARB-pharmacophores’ when evaluating a potential for the compounds’ general antineoplastic activity. Future studies will determine the reasons for cell-type specificity of these compounds. The thio-sugar motif appears to be a promising lead for future developments."
