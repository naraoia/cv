abstract = "Methacrylate monomers used in dentistry have been shown to induce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), one of the most serious DNA damage. In the present work we show that a model dental adhesive consisting of 45% 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 55% bisphenol A-diglycidyl dimethacrylate (Bis-GMA) at concentrations up to 0.25 mM Bis-GMA induced oxidative DNA in cultured primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) as evaluated by the comet assay and probed with human 8-hydroxyguanine DNA-glycosylase 1. HEMA/Bis-GMA induced DSBs in HGFs as assessed by the neutral comet assay and phosphorylation of the H2AX histone and sodium ascorbate or melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine) both at 50 Î¼M reduced the DSBs, they also inhibited apoptosis induced by HEMA/Bis-GMA. The adhesive slowed the kinetics of the repair of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in HGFs, while sodium ascorbate or melatonin improved the efficacy of H(2)O(2)-induced damage in the presence of the methacrylates. The adhesive induced a rise in the G2/M cell population, accompanied by a reduction in the S cell population and an increase in G0/G1 cell population. Sodium ascorbate or melatonin elevated the S population and reduced the G2/M population. In conclusion, HEMA/Bis-GMA induce DSBs through, at least in part, oxidative mechanisms, and these compounds may interfere with DSBs repair. Vitamin C or melatonin may reduce the detrimental effects induced by methacrylates applied in dentistry."
