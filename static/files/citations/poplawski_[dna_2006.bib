 abstract = {{DNA} double-strand breaks ({DSBs}) are the most serious {DNA} damage. Due to a great variety of factors causing {DSBs}, the efficacy of their repair is crucial for the cell's functioning and prevents {DNA} fragmentation, chromosomal translocation and deletion. In mammalian cells {DSBs} can be repaired by non-homologous end joining ({NHEJ}), homologous recombination ({HRR}) and single strand annealing ({SSA}). {HRR} can be divided into the first and second phase. The first phase is initiated by sensor proteins belonging to the {MRN} complex, that activate the {ATM} protein which target {HRR} proteins to obtain the second response phase--repair. {HRR} is precise because it utilizes a non-damaged homologous {DNA} fragment as a template. The key players of {HRR} in mammalian cells are {MRN}, {RPA}, Rad51 and its paralogs, Rad52 and Rad54.},
