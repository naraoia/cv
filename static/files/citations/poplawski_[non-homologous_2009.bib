 abstract = {Humans use primarily nonhomologous end joining ({NHEJ}) to repair {DNA} double strand breaks ({DSBs}), which are the most serious {DNA} damage, resulting in cell death if non-repaired or missrepaired. {NHEJ} directly joins together {DNA} ends resulted from {DSBs}. This pathway plays a key role in the development of vertebrate immune system through its involvement in the V(D)J recombination. Classical {NHEJ} in vertebrates involves a heterodimer of Ku proteins, the catalytic subunits of {DNA}-dependent protein kinase ({DNA}-{PKCS}), Artemis, Cernunnos-{XLF} and {XRCC}4/ligase {DNA} {IV} complex. This classical pathway may be assisted by {DNA} polymerases mu and lambda. Last 2 years brought new information on the mechanisms, proteins and functions of this {DNA} repair pathway. In 2006 Cernunnos-{XLF} was discovered, a protein playing a key role in {NHEJ}. Some alternative {NHEJ} pathways were also identified, lacking some of the main proteins of classical {NHEJ}, but involving other factors, including {BRCA}1, 53BP1, {hPNK}, {WRN} or {MDC}1. The results obtained so far suggest that not all key components and basic mechanisms of {NHEJ} have been identified. Future aspects of {NHEJ} research should include the determination of its role in cancer, aging, immune system development and basic nuclear metabolism.},
