 abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {GOAL}: Melatonin may inhibit reactive oxygen species-related pathogenesis in the alimentary tract by neutralizing free radicals. In the present study we assessed the potential protective action of melatonin in ulcerlike dyspepsia.
{STUDY}: Sixty patients aged 19 to 39 years with the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia according to the Rome Criteria {II} and no Helicobacter pylori infection were involved in the study. Melatonin, at a dose of 5 mg (n=30), or placebo (n=30) were taken in the evening for a period of 12 weeks. At this time, patients were on an equivalent diet and were only to take an alkaline drug in case of the abdominal pain.
{RESULTS}: After 12 weeks, the dyspeptic symptoms completely subsided in 17 patients in the melatonin-treatment group (56.6\%). In other 9 individuals (30.0\%) a partial improvement in health was achieved, especially in the frequency and intensity of nocturnal pain. After placebo, the majority of patients (93.3\%) did not experience any improvement in symptoms. Multivariate analysis indicated that melatonin (odds ratio 95.86, 95\% confidence interval 3.72-2469.37, P{\textless}0.01) correlated independently with significantly improved patients health. H. pylori past infection decreased positive effect of melatonin in ulcerlike dyspepsia.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Melatonin can be considered as an auxiliary drug in the treatment of ulcerlike dyspepsia.},
