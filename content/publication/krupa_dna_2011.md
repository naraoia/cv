abstract = "The cellular reaction to the DNA-damaging agents may modulate individual's cancer susceptibility. This reaction is mainly determined by the efficacy of DNA repair, which in turn, may be influenced by the variability of DNA repair genes, expressed by their polymorphism. The hOGG1 gene encodes a glycosylase of base excision repair and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair. Both proteins can be involved in the repair of DNA lesions, which are known to contribute to endometrial cancer. In the present work we determined the extent of basal DNA damage and the efficacy of removal of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro N-nitrosoguanidyne (MNNG) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 endometrial cancer patients and 30 individuals without cancer. The results from DNA damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of two common polymorphisms of the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes: a GtextgreaterC transversion at 1245 position of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser → Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a GtextgreaterC substitution at 135 position of the RAD51 gene (the 135GtextgreaterC polymorphism). DNA damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis and genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. We observed a strong association between endometrial cancer and the C/C genotype of the 135GtextgreaterC polymorphism of the RAD51 gene. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and endometrial cancer occurrence in subjects with a high level of basal DNA damage. We did not observe any correlation between the Ser326Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and endometrial cancer. Our result suggest that the 135GtextgreaterC polymorphism of the RAD51 gene may be linked to endometrial cancer and can be considered as an additional marker of this disease."
