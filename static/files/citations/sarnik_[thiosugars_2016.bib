 abstract = {Thiosugars are carbohydrate analogs in which one or few of the oxygen atoms were replaced by sulfur. The sulfur atom which is present in the furan and pyran structures, changes biological properties of carbohydrates, as compared to their oxygen analogs. Among others, thiosugars are effective inhibitors of various cellular and enzymatic pathways and also have great therapeutic potential. They are used as a drugs in diabetes and infectious diseases treatment. Recent evidence suggests that these compounds may have therapeutic properties and be also used in the treatment of some pathological conditions, including cancer diseases. This research are aimed towards the development and improvement of the current methods of synthesis of new thiosugars through stabilization of sulfur bonds and in vitro and in vivo analysis of their potential therapeutic properties. In this work the summary of the latest reports about thiosugars and their application in the medicine is presented for the first time in the Polish language literature.},
