 abstract = {(1-4)-S-thiodisaccharides were shown to kill various cancer cell lines, including cervix, lung, mammary-gland and colon by unknown mechanisms. Here we identified two actions of levoglucosenone derived (1-4)-S-thiodisaccharides against cervix cancer cells: induction of oxidative stress and DNA damage. In consequence, (1-4)-S-thiodisaccharides lowered the cellular GSH level and changed the expression profile of genes encoding key proteins involved with oxidative stress response. We also observed that (1-4)-S-thiodisaccharides induced DNA damage and interfered with the thioredoxin (Trx) system. Both actions, as induced by FPC6, were stronger when dihedral angles of sulfur bridge were set to 110°, 100° and 109°, clearly indicating differences when compared to FPC8. These findings demonstrate that the 1-4-thio bridge of disaccharide is a powerful anticancer pharmacophore, and its potential use needs further studies.},
