abstract = "The oxidative damage of DNA expresses severe cell lesion. The excess of oxygen free radicals is one of the causes of this type of disorders. Such a situation could occur in the course of H. pylori infection. Melatonin is a natural and very active antioxidant compound. AIM OF STUDY: To establish weather an administration of melatonin decreases oxidative DNA damage in gastric mucosa cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 80 subjects, divided into two groups: group I (n=30)--patients with functional dyspepsia, H. pylori positive (+), with Epigastric Pain Syndrome, with H. pylori infection; group II (n=30)--patients H. pylori negative (-) with the same form of functional dyspepsia. The control group (0) comprised 20 subjects, aged 21-60 years. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, non-infected with H. pylori the level of oxidative DNA damage in gastric mucosa cells was 6.95 +/- 2.98. In both study groups the percentage of oxidative DNA damage was respectively: 12.12 +/- 5.48% and 13.62 +/- 4.58% (p textless 0.001). The differences in the results obtained in both study groups, that is H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) were similar (p textgreater 0.05). In group of patients with functional dyspepsia and H. pylori infection the level of oxidative DNA damage in gastrocytes was 12.12 +/- 5.48%, and after 3 months administration of melatonin it decreased to the value 10.55 +/- 0.63% (p textless 0.001). In patients with functional dyspepsia, without H. pylori infection the decrease of the level of oxidative DNA damages after melatonin administration was statistically significant and it was respectively: 13.62 +/- 4.58% (p textless 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In functional dyspepsia, especially with coexisting H. pylori infection the oxidative DNA damage in gastric mucosa cells is observed. The melatonin administration changes the above mentioned oxidative DNA damage significantly."
