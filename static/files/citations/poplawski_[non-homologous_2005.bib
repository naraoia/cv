 abstract = {DNA double strand breaks (DSB) are the most serious form of DNA damage. Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is one of three major pathways for the repair of DSBs in human cells. In this process two DNA ends are joined directly, usually with no sequence homology, although in the case of same polarity of the single stranded overhangs in DSBs, regions of microhomology are utilized. NHEJ is typically imprecise, a characteristic that is useful for immune diversification in lymphocytes in V(D)J recombination. The main components of the NHEJ system in eukaryotes are the catalytic subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), Ku proteins, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and Artemis. This review focuses on the mechanisms an dregulation of DSB repair by NHEJ in mammalian cells.},
