 abstract = {The cell's susceptibility to mutagens and its ability to repair {DNA} lesions are important for cancer induction, promotion and progression. Both the mutagens' sensitivity and the efficacy of {DNA} repair may be affected by variation in several genes, including {DNA} repair genes. The {hOGG}1 gene encodes glycosylase of base excision repair and {RAD}51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair. Both can be involved in the repair of oxidative {DNA} lesions, which can contribute to stomach cancer. In the present work we determined the level of basal and oxidative {DNA} damage and the kinetics of removal of {DNA} damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 gastric cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals. The metrics from {DNA} damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of common polymorphisms of the {hOGG}1 and {RAD}51 genes: a G--{\textgreater}C transversion at 1245 position of the {hOGG}1 gene producing a Ser--{\textgreater}Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G--{\textgreater}C substitution at position 135 (5'-untranslated region) of the {RAD}51 gene (the G135C polymorphism). {DNA} damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by {DNA} repair enzymes: endonuclease {III} (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-{DNA} glycosylase (Fpg), preferentially recognizing oxidized {DNA} bases. The genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism {PCR}. We observed a strong association between gastric cancer occurrence, impaired {DNA} repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the {RAD}51 gene. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and stomach cancer occurrence in subjects with high level of oxidatively damaged {DNA}. We did not observe any correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the {hOGG}1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired {DNA} repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative {DNA} lesions. Therefore, our result suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the {RAD}51 gene may be linked with gastric cancer by the modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and this polymorphism may be a useful additional marker in this disease along with the genetic or/and environmental indicators of oxidative stress.},
