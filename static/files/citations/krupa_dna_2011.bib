 abstract = {The cellular reaction to the {DNA}-damaging agents may modulate individual's cancer susceptibility. This reaction is mainly determined by the efficacy of {DNA} repair, which in turn, may be influenced by the variability of {DNA} repair genes, expressed by their polymorphism. The {hOGG}1 gene encodes a glycosylase of base excision repair and {RAD}51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair. Both proteins can be involved in the repair of {DNA} lesions, which are known to contribute to endometrial cancer. In the present work we determined the extent of basal {DNA} damage and the efficacy of removal of {DNA} damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro N-nitrosoguanidyne ({MNNG}) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 endometrial cancer patients and 30 individuals without cancer. The results from {DNA} damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of two common polymorphisms of the {hOGG}1 and {RAD}51 genes: a G{\textgreater}C transversion at 1245 position of the {hOGG}1 gene producing a Ser → Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G{\textgreater}C substitution at 135 position of the {RAD}51 gene (the 135G{\textgreater}C polymorphism). {DNA} damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis and genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism {PCR}. We observed a strong association between endometrial cancer and the C/C genotype of the 135G{\textgreater}C polymorphism of the {RAD}51 gene. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and endometrial cancer occurrence in subjects with a high level of basal {DNA} damage. We did not observe any correlation between the Ser326Cys polymorphism of the {hOGG}1 gene and endometrial cancer. Our result suggest that the 135G{\textgreater}C polymorphism of the {RAD}51 gene may be linked to endometrial cancer and can be considered as an additional marker of this disease.},
