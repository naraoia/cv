 abstract = {The combination of etoposide and cisplatin represents a common modality for treating of glioma patients. These drugs directly and indirectly produce the most lethal {DNA} double-stand breaks ({DSB}), which are mainly repaired by non-homologous {DNA} end joining ({NHEJ}). Drugs that can specifically inhibit the kinase activity of the catalytic subunit of {DNA}-dependent protein kinase ({DNA}-{PKcs}), the major component of {NHEJ}, are of special interest in cancer research. These small molecule inhibitors can effectively enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments that generate {DNA} damage. In this study, we investigated the effect of {DNA}-{PKcs} inhibitor, wortmannin, on the cytotoxic mechanism of etoposide and cisplatin in {MO}59K and {MO}59J human glioblastoma cell lines. These cell lines are proficient and deficient in {DNA}-{PKcs}, respectively. Wortmannin synergistically increased the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and etoposide, when combined, in {NHEJ}-proficient {MO}59K cells. Surprisingly, wortmannin sensitizing effect was also observed in {DNA}-{PKcs}-deficient {MO}59J cells. These data suggest that wortmannin sensitization to etoposide and cisplatin in human glioma cells is mediated by inhibition of not only {DNA}-{PKcs} activity but other enzymes from {PI}3-K family, e.g. {ATM} and {ATR}. A concentration-dependent increase in etoposide and cisplatin-induced {DSB} levels was potentiated by inhibitor in both cell lines. Moreover, drug-induced accumulation in the G2/M checkpoint and S-phase was increased by wortmannin. Wortmannin significantly inhibited drug-induced {DSB} repair in {MO}59 cells and this effect was more pronounced in {MO}59J cells. We conclude that the mechanism of wortmannin potentiation of etoposide and cisplatin cytotoxicity involves {DSBs} induction, {DSBs} repair inhibition, G2/M checkpoint arrest and inhibition of not only {DNA}-{PKcs} activity.},
