 abstract = {Imatinib ({STI}571) is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative used mostly in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. It targets the {BCR}/{ABL} oncogenic tyrosine kinase, inhibiting its activity. Using the alkaline comet assay we showed that {STI}571 at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 Î¼M induced {DNA} damage in human leukemic K562 and {BV}173 cells expressing the {BCR}/{ABL} oncogene, whereas it had no effect in normal human lymphocytes and leukemic {CCRF}-{CEM} cells without the expression of {BCR}/{ABL}. Imatinib did not induce {DNA} strand breaks in the direct interaction with {DNA} as examined by the circular plasmid relaxation assay. Because the extent of {DNA} damage observed in the neutral and {pH} 12.1 versions of the comet assay was much lesser than in the alkaline version, we concluded that the drug induced {DNA} alkali-labile sites rather than strand breaks. K562 cells were unable to repair H2O2-induced {DNA} damage during a 120-min incubation, if they had been preincubated with {STI}571, whereas normal lymphocytes did so within 60 min. Pre-treatment of K562 cells with Vitamins A, C and E reduced the extent of {DNA} damage evoked by {STI}571. Similar results brought experiments with the nitrone spin traps {POBN} and {PBN}, suggesting that free radicals may be involved in the formation of {DNA} lesions induced by {STI}571 in K562 cells. These cells exposed to imatinib and treated with endonuclease {III}, formamidopyrimidine-{DNA} glycosylase and 3-methyladenine-{DNA} glycosylase {II}, the enzymes recognizing oxidized and alkylated bases, displayed greater extent of {DNA} damage than those not treated with these enzymes. Therefore, the mechanism of the anti-leukemic action of {STI}571 may involve not only the inhibition of {BCR}/{ABL}, but also {DNA} damage in the cells expressing this fusion protein. {DNA} damage induced by {STI}571 may follow from oxidative and alkylative base modifications.},
