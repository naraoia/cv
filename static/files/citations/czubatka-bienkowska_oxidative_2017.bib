 abstract = {Thio-sugars have been described as potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth but the detailed mechanism of action remains unknown. Herein we investigated the mechanism of their anticancer action in the {HeLa} cell line. We investigated two thio-sugars: 5-thio-d-glucose ({FCP}1) and 6-thio-Î²-d-fructopyranose ({FCP}2). We have observed that {FCP}1 as well as {FCP}2 clearly induced oxidative {DNA} lesions in cancer cells and increased the level of cellular {ROS}. A spin trap and antioxidants have decreased the level of {DNA} lesions induced by {FCPs}. {FCPs} also induced significant changes in the oxidative-stress gene expression. Therefore, we assume that {ROS} generation is correlated with the increased {NOX}5 expression by {FCPs}. Higher cyto- and genotoxicity of {FCPs} for {HeLa} cells in a low glucose environment suggested their role in the glucose metabolism. The data indicates that thio-sugars may become drug alternatives for the cancer treatment but such undertaking needs further studies.},
