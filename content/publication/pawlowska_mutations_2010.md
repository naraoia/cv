abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Oligodontia, a congenital lack of six or more teeth, is often associated with mutations in the PAX9 gene; therefore, we searched for mutations in this gene. DESIGN: In the present work, we sequenced fragments of the PAX9 gene in individuals with sporadic oligodontia. Next, we genotyped some mutations we found in patients with oligodontia and individuals without tooth agenesis. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: DNA sequencing was performed in the material isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of six unrelated patients with sporadic, non-syndromic oligodontia. These patients were selected based upon explorative cluster analysis. Genotyping was performed in 38 patients with oligodontia and 100 control individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR were employed. RESULTS: We detected two homozygotic substitutions, IVS2-109GtextgreaterC and IVS2-54AtextgreaterG, in intron 2 in three patients. Another homozygotic substitution in intron 2, IVS2-41AtextgreaterG, was revealed in two patients. Two patients had an IVS3+40GtextgreaterA homozygotic change in intron 3 and 4 patients displayed a 717CtextgreaterT transition in exon 4 (silent mutation). One patient had a heterozygotic 718GtextgreaterC transversion, resulting in a missense Ala240Pro substitution. We detected also several other intronic substitutions. Further genotyping of the IVS2-54AtextgreaterG, IVS2-109GtextgreaterC, and IVS2-41AtextgreaterG mutations suggested that they can display polymorphic changes. CONCLUSION: The IVS2-54AtextgreaterG, IVS2-109GtextgreaterC, and IVS2-41AtextgreaterG mutations of the PAX9 gene may represent polymorphism associated with sporadic oligodontia."
